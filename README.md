    Step 1 To download models from Hugging Face, you must first have a Huggingface account. Sign up at this URL, and then obtain your token at this location.
    
    
    Step 2. Request Llama 2 --> Otherwise use OpenAI if you have access to that model 
       To download and use the Llama 2 model, simply fill out Metaâ€™s form to request access. Please note that utilizing Llama 2 is contingent upon accepting the Meta license agreement.
    After filling out the form, you will receive an email containing a URL that can be used to download the model.

    Step 3. Access to Llama-2 model on Huggingface, submit access form
    Please note that the email you enter in step 2 must match the one you used to create your Hugging Face account in step 1. If they do not match, step 3 will not be successful.
